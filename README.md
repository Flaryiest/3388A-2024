Code for VEX V5RC High Stakes team 3388A, Aries.
The code is written in c++ with PROS and lemlib as the main library.
Sadly the code is unusable for other people as it was made solely for our robot, however their are concepts such as wall stake hovering that may be copyable to other robots.
Throughout the season, the code has changed a lot due to improvements to the bot.
I've also worked a lot on the physical aspect of the robot, primarily made with aluminum c channels.
